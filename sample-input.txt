I bought the 256GB version and also reviewed it here http://goo.gl/e3tLhT

This is my second device from Apple.In the past i have used a bunch of laptops and usually switch them after a year and so.Mostly i bought products from HP and lenovo.The last one was Lenovo Ideapad Y510,which was kind of a good device but bad battery life for a traveler like me.
So, the main reason i bought the macbook pro was the good battery life and excellent performance it offered.
Apple MacBook Pro MF840HN/A is the latest version of this one http://amzn.to/1EvEWcb
