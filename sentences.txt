I am leery of my kid having too much technology at her fingertips and being too plugged in with internet, etc.
So it was really silly of me to agree to buy her this phone.
(Actually she said she'd pay me from the allowance she's saved, but I've yet to see the cash.
But, I digress.
) Anyway, the phone is very cute, and has nice features.
It's got a functional, albeit lower grade camera on the back.
She can download music, surf the web, chat with buddies on Skype, and play games like Angry Birds (one of her favorite apps).
It's got custom Hello Kitty wallpaper and ringtones.
The size is right, not too large like some of the smart-phones on the market.
For us, it was a right fit for the price point.
My daughter has been thrilled with the purchase, so we are satisfied.
